The game currently has 2 mode: normal.py as a recreation of the original version back to 1985, which use random to determine the next direction and when to shoot, and hard.py uses limited A* search for next direction and scripted action pattern(jiggle and charge) as the back up if limited A* star doesn't return a vaild direction, and will only shoot when player aligned with enemy tank.
